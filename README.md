## Abstract
Cyberspace operations are an increasingly important mission focus and warfighting domain within the Department of Defense (DOD). There are a number of educational courses and training exercises that have been developed to prepare leaders to plan and execute cyberspace-based effects to support operations; however, there are currently no virtual simulations used by the military to train and educate servicemembers in the basic concepts of cyberspace operations. Because of this training gap, we have designed and developed CyberWar: 2025, a simultaneous turn-based multiplatform computer-based educational wargame that is intended to be used as a support tool for education and training of basic cyberspace operations concepts to military professionals and other DOD personnel. The objective of CyberWar: 2025 is to stimulate, build, and increase the playersâ€™ knowledge base and experience in planning and practical application of cyberspace operations in the areas of defensive cyberspace operations, offensive cyberspace operations, and computer network exploitation. CyberWar: 2025 focuses on doctrine and doctrinal training as a serious game by reinforcing key learning objectives set by the DOD; however, this wargame also encourages player engagement and motivation through unique and balanced multiplayer interactions within a virtual environment.
